# New Load Bank PCB

This project contains the Altium PCB design files for the next iteration of the remote-controlled Load Bank switches.

The modular switchboards themselves are contained in the `Load_Bank_Switch_New` folder.

The master control board is contained in a yet-to-be-created folder.

The library that contains the symbols and footprints of all the parts used are `Schematic_Library.SchLib` and `Footprint_Library.PcbLib`.

The `Project Outputs for Load_Bank_Switch_New_IntLib/Load_Bank_Switch_New_IntLib.IntLib` file contains the actual integrated library.

Finally, the `3d_models` folder contains the 3D models of all the components used on the board.
